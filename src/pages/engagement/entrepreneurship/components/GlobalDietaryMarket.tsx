          We again thought of different ways how to make money out of this concept and were mostly deciding between pursuing the B2C and B2B business models.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          B2C has its advantages when it comes to higher margins and brand building, but comes with high marketing expenses. On the other hand,{' '}
          <span className="font-bold">B2B offers lower margins but reaching more users is easier than with B2C</span>. We therefore looked for{' '}
          <span className="font-bold">B2B customers</span>. These would be{' '}
          <span className="font-bold">manufacturers of health and dietary supplements</span>. We would be able to offer them novel ingredient to use in their products.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Besides that, we also explored, whether they would be interested in trying out{' '}
          <span className="font-bold">fresh duckweed</span>. Something like novel microgreens. As there are some companies offering duckweed in this form, we hypothesized there would be interest for this kind product. We reached out to several companies and managed to get a positive feedback from them.
