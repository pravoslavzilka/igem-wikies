            In the beginning of our iGEM journey, we have been excited by the biotech entrepreneurship and startups, so we joined{' '}

          <p>
            Lifbee is an 8-month program focused on turning science into business. The first 4 months focus on training in entrepreneurship and design thinking, followed by a 4-month incubator where teams develop biotech startup ideas, validate them and present at{' '}
            <span className="font-bold">Lifbee finals</span>. We built on our iGEM Startups project{' '}
            <span className="font-bold">NitroDuck</span> - using genetically modified duckweed, vertical cultivation and synthetic biology â€“ to create a sustainable protein feed that reduces costs and nitrogen pollution in agriculture.
