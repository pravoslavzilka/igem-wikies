                        Our project begun somewhat peculiarly. At first, we wanted to build a
                        startup and even took part in{" "}
                        <span className="font-bold">iGEM Startups</span> program last year (you
                        can read more about it in our{" "}

                        </a>{" "}
                        section), contrary to most of the projects that start this program only
                        after finishing the iGEM Competition. But thatâ€™s because we approached
                        iGEM from the<span className="font-bold"> â€˜problem firstâ€™</span>{" "}
                        perspective.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is how we first learnt about the{" "}
                        <span className="font-bold">
              unsustainable production of protein for animal feed
            </span>
                        . Here we came up with the idea of using duckweed grown in vertical
                        cultivation systems, where liquid part of manure would be pumped.
                        Duckweed, genetically engineered for higher ammonium tolerance, would
                        take up the ammonium, prevent it from being evaporated and utilize it
                        into protein. This duckweed was meant to be fed back to cows that
                        produced the manure. Closing the nitrogen loop right on the farm!
                        Sounds amazing right?

                    ones that are closest to the problem â€“ farmers.

                            with current options, as that is what matters to him the most.
