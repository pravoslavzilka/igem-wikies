                        Our project begun somewhat peculiarly. At first, we wanted to build a startup and even
                        took part in <span className="font-bold">iGEM Startups</span> program last year (you can
                        read more about it in our{" "}
                        <a href="http://localhost:4176/engagement/entrepreneurship"

                        </a>{" "}
                        section), contrary to most of the projects that start this program only after finishing
                        the iGEM Competition. But thatâ€™s because we approached iGEM from the
                        <span className="font-bold"> â€˜problem firstâ€™</span> perspective.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is how we first learnt about the{" "}
                        <span className="font-bold">unsustainable production of protein for animal feed</span>.
                        Here we came up with the idea of using duckweed grown in vertical cultivation systems,
                        where liquid part of manure would be pumped. Duckweed, genetically engineered for higher
                        ammonium tolerance, would take up the ammonium, prevent it from being evaporated and
                        utilize it into protein. This duckweed was meant to be fed back to cows that produced the
                        manure. Closing the nitrogen loop right on the farm! Sounds amazing right?

                                After presenting him the solution we ideated he was thrilled. He

                                entire farm operation. He is aware that soybean is not ideal in terms

                                <span className="font-bold">
            the best available source of protein on the market.

                                When we talked about duckweed's amazing traits, he said he is{" "}

                                as it's finished. But he stressed the fact, that it has to be{" "}
                                <span className="font-bold">profitable and cost-competitive</span> with
                                current options, as that is what matters to him the most.
