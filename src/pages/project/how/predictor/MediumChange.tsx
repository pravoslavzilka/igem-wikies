              The inevitable part of successful duckweed cultivation is regular 
              cultivation medium change. It is necessary due to nutrient depletion 
              during the growth of our duckweed cultures. The nutrient uptake 
              increases over time as the biomass increases and there is also a 
              need to monitor and act accordingly. The importance of pinpointing the 
              minimum frequency of medium change is further underscored by 
              understanding high demand for minimal necessary maintenance 
              needs, so that energy, resources and labour are used effectively.

            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-sm" style={{ fontFamily: 'Urbanist, sans-serif' }}>
              To determine the minimum frequency of medium change, two types of 
              experiments were conducted simultaneously: a control experimental with 
              fresh medium every day (so that medium nutrient depletion or any 
              nutrient depletion should be negligible) and another without any 
              medium change, which was performed in two replicates. Each of the 3 
              culture trays (with a cultivation area of 0.0544 m¬≤) was inoculated by 
              30 g of Lemna gibotossi (#527) or 5.4kg/ha (0.1kg/L) at the biomass 
              density. Biomass was weighed every 2 days to study of 
              medium change necessary to ensure the fastest growth rate. It was 
              conducted as a point where the measured biomass in the 
              experimental group started to lag behind the measured biomass in the 
              control group.

Every day is ensuring the fastest growth, so not the maximal biomass yields of the control group and experimental groups start to deviate noticeably.
