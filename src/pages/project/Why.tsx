      description: "Duckweeds, especially Wolffia globosa, have been used traditionally as food in Southeast Asia and are now gaining interest globally for their nutritional potential. With as much protein as soybeans, full amino acid profile, and a biomass doubling time of just 48 hours, duckweed could be a novel source of protein for animal feed or even human consumption. Nutrient analyses across all five genera confirm alignment with WHO recommendations. Duckweed is also used as feed for livestock and fish, often surpassing corn in protein content. Though pricing limits widespread livestock use, it holds strong potential in premium pet food and functional foods."

      description: "Duckweeds can remove heavy metals, pharmaceutical residues and nutrients like nitrates and phosphates from polluted water. Duckweed are also easy to harvest - a key advantage. Once the contaminants are taken up, the plants can be collected and processed, enabling the safe removal of harmful substances from the environment. Adding to their value is the fact that duckweeds thrive under a wide range of conditions: tolerating pH values from 4 to 9 (), temperatures from 5¬∞C to 38¬∞C (), and adapting to environments ranging from low light to full sunlight (). Therefore, their phytoremediation capabilities are not limited to a narrow set of conditions and can be deployed broadly."

      description: "Bacteria are the workhorse of bioproduction - until they need to create molecules with complex post-translational modifications (). For that, either yeast or Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are used (). What truly sets plants apart in recombinant protein production is their scalability. You can grow millions of plants in fields, with minimal cost compared to sterile bioreactors (). Even better: if you're expressing those proteins in duckweed, you can fit up to 900 m2 of surface area into a single large shipping container - resulting in hundreds of millions of plants on your ground floor. Plants with almost no gene silencing (), allowing for high-level protein overexpression. However, the drawback is plant glycosylation ‚Äì it is not identical to mammalian glycosylation ()..."

      description: "Most plant scientists currently work with Arabidopsis or tobacco as model organisms (). However, since both are dicots and many staple crops are monocots, not all discoveries in these two species are directly transferable to agricultural crops (). Duckweeds, being monocots, offer a promising alternative. As the smallest flowering plants (), they reproduce primarily asexually (), exhibit unique gene-silencing patterns (), and grow extremely fast, allowing experiments to be conducted 5 to 30 times faster than with traditional model plants, depending on the comparison. On the other hand, duckweed unique traits may both illuminate fundamental plant processes and pose challenges when translating findings to other crops."

            At iGEM Brno, we are convinced that this is not enough to fully utilize the amazing capabilities of duckweed. 
And because we believe that the success of technology lies in its user-friendliness,

We developed TAIFR and characterized duckweed-native promoters, so anyone can engineer duckweed efficiently. We built an autonomous cultivation prototype, allowing anyone to grow duckweed in their lab cheaply and without labour.

And that is also why we went to iGEM - to show the entire SynBio community the potential of duckweed and to make tools available for anyone to unlock it!
